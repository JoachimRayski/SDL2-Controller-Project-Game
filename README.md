# SUPER MICRO-BOT BEAR SURGERY ULTIMATE
## Game Proposal

### Game Mechanics
"SUPER MICRO-BOT BEAR SURGERY ULTIMATE" is a game about a teddy bear who is undergoing micro-bot surgery. The player remotely operates a nanobot in the bear's organism using a knob and a button, the knob rotates the bot and the button applies forward momentum. The player has to navigate the bot in such a way as to not damage teddy's healthy tissue and strike down any bacteria it encounters.

### Controller Design
The controller is made up of two parts, the micro-bot controller and the teddy bear.

The micro-bot controller is made out of a simple potentiometer and a button inside of a box. The potentiometer rotates the micro-bot and the button applies forward momentum to it.

The teddy bear has two DC motors in his arms and an infrared proximity sensor in his mouth. If his tissue becomes damaged in the game by the player, the motors activate and the bear starts freaking out in pain and moving his arms frantically. To calm him down, the player has to press an anaesthetic mask to his mouth for a set period of time. The bear then stops moving as if falling asleep.

"Penultimo" is a katamari-like game where you play as a blob which collects blobs of different colours. The collest part about this game, is that it is hooked up to a big cocktail making contraption which creates a unique cocktail mix depending on what blobs you collect.

"Incontroller" is a simple ball rolling game with an unusual way of increasing the difficulty. Instead of making the game itself harder, it makes the controller itself more difficult to use by making the arrow keys move both horizontally and vertically.

"Orpheus Quest" is a rhythm game where you play on a harp. Not just any harp, but a laser harp. The ingenious contraption detects when your finger is obstructing a laser beam on the harp, which makes them function like strings.
